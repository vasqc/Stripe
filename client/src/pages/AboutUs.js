            Not all water is created equal. How is that possible you may ask?
            Well, there are different criteria that are considered in order to
            classify these different waters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Source Where did the water actually come from? TDS (Total Dissolved
            Solids) What is actually in the water? Different minerals, from
            naturally occuring sources, overtime make it into our favorite
            watering holes. The outcome is the visua aspectl and most importantly,
            the overall taste. (And of course Nutrition) Bubbles: Is it sparkiling?
            did a person put those bubbles in? or did mother earth? "Well, I don't
            like my water with bubbles!" Thats ok, there is STILL water available
            to you too. (but this is where it gets tricky, we'll talk about that
            much later.)
